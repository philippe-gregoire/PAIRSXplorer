# Developer Documentation for `uibuilderfe.js`

This is the front-end library. It provides socket.io connectivity, simplified message handling and a simple event handler for monitoring for new messages.

## Variable Handling

All public variables must be accessed from your own code using the getter:

```javascript
var myvar = uibuilder.get('varName')
```

All public variables must be changed from your own code using the setter:

```javascript
uibuilder.set('varName',value)
```

Internally to the library, all variable access should be via `self.get()` and `self.set()`. This is to ensure that the event system is triggered when setting.

## Public Variables

### Externally Writable (via .set method, read via .get method)

* `allowScript`  {boolean} [true] Allow incoming msg to contain msg.script with JavaScript that will be automatically executed
* `allowStyle`  {boolean} [true] Allow incoming msg to contain msg.style with CSS that will be automatically executed
* `removeScript` {boolean} [true] Delete msg.code after inserting to DOM if it exists on incoming msg
* `removeStyle`  {boolean} [true] Delete msg.style after inserting to DOM if it exists on incoming msg
* `autoSendReady` {boolean} [true] If true, a REPLAY control message is sent once the client receives a "client connected" control message from the server.

### Externally read-only (via .get method)

* `msg` {Object} Copy of the last standard message received from the server

* `msgsReceived` {integer} Number of messages received from server since page load

  

* `ctrlMsg` {Object} Copy of last control msg object received from sever

* `msgsCtrl` {integer} Track number of control messages received from server since page load

  

* `sentMsg` {Object} Copy of last standard msg object sent via `uibuilder.send()`

* `msgsSent` {integer} Number of messages sent to server since page load

  

* `sentCtrlMsg` {Object} Copy of the last control message sent via `uibuilder.send()`

* `msgsCtrlSent` {integer} Number of control messages sent to server since page load

  

* `ioConnected` {boolean} [false]

* `serverTimeOffset` {null|number} [null] Difference in hours between the Node-RED servers time and the browser time. Useful if you need to process date/time values from the server. The uibuilder node sends a timestamp in control messages so just reloading the page will force an update.

* `debug` {boolean} [false] Do not set directly.  Set using `uibuilder.debug(true/false)`. Query using `uibuilder.debug()`.

* `moduleName` {string} ['uibuilder'] The module name in use, `uibuilder`. Must match the module name in use on the server node.

* `version` {string} The version number of the uibuilderfe library.

These are unlikely to be needed externally but can be accessed:

* `ioChannels` [{control: 'uiBuilderControl', client:'uiBuilderClient', server:'uiBuilder' }]
* `retryMs` [2000] Starting retry ms period for manual socket reconnections workaround
* `retryFactor` [1.5] Starting delay factor for subsequent reconnect attempts
* `timerid` [null] Holder for the socket reconnection timer
* `ioNamespace` [calculated] The socket.io namespace. Must match that of the node instance you want to talk to. Tries to calculate automatically based on the hosting web pages URL. However, can be overridden using the options object in `uibuilder.start()`
* `ioTransport` [['polling', 'websocket']]
* `loaded` {boolean} Are all browser resources loaded?

## Private Variables

These are only accessible from within the library.

* `events` Holds an array of event callbacks for the event management system
* 

## Public Methods

These are are available from user code via `uibuilder.xxxx()`. Many also have private equivalents.

* `set`
* `get`
* `onChange`
* `msg`
* `send`
* `sendCtrl`
* 

## Private Methods

These are not available to users via `uibuilder.xxxx()`. They can only be accessed from within the library.

* `uiDebug` Controllable console output. If the debug variable is true, this will output to console.
* `me`
* `setIOnamespace` Attempt to work out the correct socket.io namespace based on the current URL. Only works if the containing HTML page is in the root URI for the uibuilder instance. Otherwise, you have to override this manually - see the `start` public variable.
* `set` Set any internal variable. Triggers the event system if needed.
* `checkConnect` Checks whether socket.io is connected to the socket server. If not, waits for a period and tries again. The wait period is controlled by 2 variables: `retryMs` and `retryFactor`. The wait period extends by the `retryFactor` for each attempt.
* `ioSetup` Sets up the Socket.io connection - called from the `start` public method. This allows user code to correct the auto-calculated socket.io namespace and path if the containing page is in a sub-folder or even on a different server.
* `send` Send a message back to the Node-RED server.
* `emit` Trigger an event
* `newScript` Handle incoming script attached to a message from Node-RED. Inserts to the DOM dynamically at the end of the `<body>`.
* `newStyle` Handle incoming styles (CSS) attached to a message from Node-RED. Inserts to the DOM dynamically at the end of the `<head>`.
* `uiReturn` Defines a set of callback style functions that are made available as external methods. See [Public Methods](#public-methods) above.
